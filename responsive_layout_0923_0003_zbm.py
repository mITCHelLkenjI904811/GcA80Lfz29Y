It demonstrates how to structure a Pyramid application with a clear structure,
including error handling, appropriate comments, and following Python best practices.

# You would also need to create a 'templates' directory with a 'home.pt' file,
# which would contain the Mako template for the responsive layout.
# Below is an example of what the 'home.pt' file might look like:

# templates/home.pt
# <%! from mako.template import Template # Importing Mako's Template class
# %>
# <%inherit file="layout.pt" />
# <%block name="content">
#     <h1>${message}</h1>
#     <p>This is a responsive layout example.</p>
# </%block>

# And a 'layout.pt' file for the base layout:
# templates/layout.pt
# <!DOCTYPE html>
# <html>
# <head>
#     <title>Responsive Layout Example</title>
#     <style>
#         /* Add your responsive CSS styles here */
#     </style>
# </head>
# <body>
#     <%block name="content"></%block>
